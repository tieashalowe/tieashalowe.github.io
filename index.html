      I spend a lot of my freetime writing because it is something that i enjoy
      to do.

    <p>
      I am a very cool person I stay in the house a lot because I like to be by
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things I enjoyed doing with my family is when we would all take trips and
      we would go out of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so fun because I liked being with my cousins all of the time
      because we do the funnest activties together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best place that I can say that we have been together that i really
      liked is Texas.

      Texas was the best to me because we went bowling and everything it was.
