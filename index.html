    <p>
      I was born May 30th, I am the oldest of my 3 siblings, and my whole family
      is from Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a in 10th grade, I moved to New Orleans the beginning of 8th grade
      year I have now been here for 2 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things that you should know about me is that I really like to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend a lot of my freetime writing because it is something that i enjoy
      to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a very cool person I stay in the house a lot because I like to be by
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things I enjoyed doing with my <a href="family.html">family</a> is when we
      would all take trips and we would go out of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so fun because I liked being with my cousins all of the time
      because we do the funnest activties together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best place that I can say that we have been together that i really
      liked is Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Texas was the best to me because we went bowling and everything it was
      fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      If i had the choice i would move back to chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to move back there because my whole family is down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I am grown one place that I would like to move is Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would move to Texas because I hear it is a lot of job oppurtunities my
      auncle moved out there for his job.
